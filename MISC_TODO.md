# Miscellaneous TODO Items

This document tracks major enhancements, fixes, and new features needed to evolve the Icy Tower MVP into a production-quality game. Items are organized by category and priority.

## 🔴 Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### Wall Bounce System
- **Wall bounce mechanics are fundamentally broken** - requires research to determine intended behavior
- Current timing-based system needs complete rework
- Collision detection with walls may have core issues
- Momentum preservation calculations need verification
- Input timing windows may be incorrectly implemented

### Core System Stability
- **Value tuning across all systems** - physics parameters, scoring, timing windows all need balancing
- Configuration values were set during development and haven't been properly tuned for gameplay

## 🟡 Major Feature Gaps

### Audio System
- **Background music system** - need dynamic music that adapts to gameplay intensity
- **Enhanced sound effects library** - current sounds are basic placeholder effects
- **Spatial audio** - sound positioning and effects based on player movement and speed
- **Audio mixing and mastering** - proper volume balancing and audio processing

### Visual Effects & Polish
- **Particle systems** - effects for jumps, landings, wall bounces, speed bursts
- **Player visual effects** - spinning animation and sparkle emissions when moving at high speed
- **Screen effects** - enhanced camera shake, screen flash, post-processing effects
- **Visual feedback systems** - better indication of successful combos, perfect timing, etc.

### Animation System
- **Enhanced player animations** - current system is basic and lacks polish
- **Smooth animation transitions** - better blending between movement states
- **Dynamic animations** - speed-based animation variations, impact animations
- **Environmental animations** - animated backgrounds, platform effects, ambient movement

### Platform Variety & Biome System
- **Biome changes every 100 levels** - different visual themes at checkpoint intervals
- **Platform type variety** - different platform materials, sizes, and behaviors
- **Smart difficulty scaling** - platforms become smaller, sparser, and more vertically spread at higher levels
- **Environmental hazards** - moving platforms, breakable platforms, boost platforms

## 🟢 Enhancement & Polish

### User Interface
- **Combo UI improvements** - current combo display needs significant enhancement
- **Main menu system** - proper game start, settings, and navigation
- **Pause/resume functionality** - in-game pause menu with options
- **Game over screen** - proper restart and score display
- **Settings menu** - audio, video, control customization
- **HUD polish** - better visual design for score, height, and combo displays

### Gameplay Systems
- **Enhanced combo system** - current implementation is rudimentary and needs expansion
- **Achievement system** - unlock conditions, progression tracking, visual rewards
- **Leaderboard/high score system** - persistent score tracking and comparison
- **Multiple difficulty modes** - preset configurations for different skill levels
- **Tutorial system** - guided introduction to game mechanics

### Technical Improvements
- **Performance profiling** - identify and optimize bottlenecks
- **Memory management** - optimize object pooling and garbage collection
- **Loading screens** - proper asset loading with progress indication
- **Error handling** - graceful handling of edge cases and errors
- **Save system** - persistent settings and progress storage

### Platform Generation Intelligence
- **Procedural difficulty curves** - smart algorithms for platform placement based on height
- **Skill-based generation** - platform layouts that encourage and reward skill development
- **Jump distance calculations** - ensure platforms are always reachable with proper momentum
- **Variety algorithms** - prevent repetitive patterns in platform generation

### Input & Accessibility
- **Gamepad support** - console controller integration
- **Mobile/touch controls** - responsive touch input for mobile devices
- **Accessibility features** - colorblind support, audio cues, customizable controls
- **Input rebinding** - customizable key mapping

### Advanced Visual Features
- **Dynamic lighting** - atmospheric lighting effects based on height/biome
- **Parallax backgrounds** - multi-layer background scrolling for depth
- **Weather effects** - environmental ambiance (rain, snow, wind)
- **Post-processing pipeline** - bloom, depth of field, color grading

## 🔵 Future Considerations

### Content Expansion
- **Multiple characters** - different player characters with unique abilities
- **Power-up system** - temporary abilities and enhancements
- **Seasonal events** - time-limited content and challenges
- **Community features** - screenshot sharing, replay system

### Technical Architecture
- **Multiplayer foundation** - networking infrastructure for future multiplayer modes
- **Analytics integration** - player behavior tracking and gameplay metrics
- **A/B testing framework** - system for testing different configurations
- **Localization support** - multi-language text and audio support

### Platform Considerations
- **Mobile optimization** - performance tuning for mobile devices
- **Console adaptation** - potential console release preparation
- **Web optimization** - browser compatibility and performance
- **Progressive Web App** - offline capabilities and app-like experience

## Priority Guidelines

- **🔴 Critical**: Must be fixed/implemented before any production release
- **🟡 Major**: Significantly impacts game quality and player experience
- **🟢 Enhancement**: Improves polish and completeness
- **🔵 Future**: Nice-to-have features for potential future releases

## Notes

This list represents the gap between the current MVP state and a production-ready game. While the core mechanics are functional, substantial work remains across all aspects of the game - visual, audio, gameplay, and technical polish.

The current codebase provides a solid foundation with good architecture, but each system needs refinement, tuning, and enhancement to deliver a compelling player experience matching the quality expectations of modern indie games.
